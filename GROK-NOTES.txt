Shawn's first discusson with Grok about this docker-compose projtect
2024-11-01

i am using docker-compose with an image of confluentinc/cp-zookeeper. when the container loads i need to start zookeeper with a bash command like zookeeper-server-start.sh. But when I open a bash shell into the running container i cannot find zookeeper-server-start.sh
what should I be calling instead?
Answer
When using the confluentinc/cp-zookeeper Docker image from Confluent Platform, you're interacting with a distribution of Apache Kafka and ZooKeeper that's designed to work seamlessly within a containerized environment. Here are some steps and considerations to help you start ZooKeeper:

Default Startup Configuration: Typically, in Dockerized environments like this, you don't need to manually start ZooKeeper or Kafka services because Docker containers are designed to run a specific command defined in the Dockerfile or by the Docker run command. For the confluentinc/cp-zookeeper image, ZooKeeper should start automatically when the container is launched.
Entrypoint: The image has an entrypoint set up to run start.sh, which handles starting ZooKeeper. You can check this by looking at the repository or Dockerfile if available. This start.sh script might handle the initialization of ZooKeeper without needing you to manually execute zookeeper-server-start.sh.
If Manual Start is Required: If for some reason you need to manually start or restart ZooKeeper within the container:
Correct Command: Instead of zookeeper-server-start.sh, you might find the command is simply zookeeper-server-start or similar, but given the containerized nature, this isn't typical for basic operations.
Environment Variables: If you need to customize ZooKeeper's startup (like specifying config file or data directory), you might set environment variables in your docker-compose.yml or directly in a docker run command. For example, setting ZOOKEEPER_CONFIG to point to a specific config file.
Checking Inside the Container: If you're looking for the script inside the container:
Log into your container with docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash or whatever shell is available.
You might not find zookeeper-server-start.sh directly as it might be part of the start script or not meant to be run directly by users in this context.
Configuration via docker-compose: In your docker-compose.yml, ensure ZooKeeper is configured correctly. Here's a basic example:
yaml
version: '2'
services:
  zookeeper:
    image: confluentinc/cp-zookeeper:7.0.1
    environment:
      ZOOKEEPER_CLIENT_PORT: 2181
      ZOOKEEPER_TICK_TIME: 2000

This example sets ZooKeeper to start with default configurations.
Debugging: If ZooKeeper isn't starting as expected, check the container logs with docker logs -f <container_id>. Look for errors or messages indicating why ZooKeeper might not start or how it's being managed.

In summary, you generally shouldn't need to manually run ZooKeeper start scripts in such containers. If you're trying to interact with ZooKeeper manually or customize its startup, look towards modifying environment variables or directly inspecting how the image is configured to start ZooKeeper. If you're still having issues, reviewing the official documentation for the Confluent Platform or the specific version's GitHub repo might offer more detailed insights into how services are meant to be started or managed within their containers.

Answer
Given your setup where ZooKeeper is already running in a container and you're using Docker Compose with the confluentinc/cp-kafka image for Kafka, here's how you might configure or start Kafka:

Configuration in docker-compose.yml: Typically, Kafka would be configured to start automatically when you bring up your Docker Compose services, especially if you're using the Confluent Platform Docker images which are designed for ease of use in containerized environments. Here's an example snippet for Kafka in docker-compose.yml:
yaml
version: '2'
services:
  kafka:
    image: confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.0.1
    depends_on:
      - zookeeper
    environment:
      KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zookeeper:2181
      KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://kafka:9092
      KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR: 1

This configuration tells Kafka to connect to ZooKeeper running at zookeeper:2181 (assuming that's the service name in your compose file). The KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS specifies how Kafka should advertise itself, which in this case is within the Docker network.
Starting Kafka Manually: If for some reason, you need to start Kafka manually or check if Kafka is running:
You generally wouldn't need to manually start Kafka inside a container due to how Docker Compose or Docker run commands are designed to handle this. However, if you're in a scenario where you're troubleshooting or need to inspect Kafka directly:
With Docker Compose, you would typically manage services through Docker Compose commands. To start or restart Kafka, you might do:
bash
docker-compose up -d kafka
If you're directly in the Kafka container and want to see if Kafka is running or start it for some reason (though this is not typical with these images):
bash
docker exec -it <kafka_container_id> /bin/bash

Inside the Kafka container, the entrypoint script will have already started Kafka. You can check Kafka logs to see if it's running:
bash
cat /var/log/kafka/kafka.log
Using Confluent CLI: If you're using the Confluent CLI, which allows for easier management of Confluent Platform components, you might not need to manually start Kafka or ZooKeeper at all. The CLI can manage starting, stopping, and configuring your services for you, often abstracting away the need to manually interact with Docker or the individual containers unless you're doing something custom or troubleshooting.
Error Handling and Configuration: If you're encountering issues where Kafka isn't starting or connecting to ZooKeeper, ensure your ZooKeeper is up and correctly configured in your Kafka environment variables. Also, check the logs for both services for any errors or misconfigurations.

Remember, with modern deployments like using Confluent's Docker images for Kafka, the expectation is that these services start automatically when the container initializes, unless explicitly configured otherwise or if there's an issue with the environment or configuration files. If you find yourself needing to manually start Kafka inside its container, it might indicate a misconfiguration or a need for custom setup not covered by default container behaviors.

I have found that when I attempt to have kafka automatically create a topic, it throws an error and exits. What is the correct environment variable name and value to create kafka topics?
Answer
When using Kafka with Docker environments, particularly with images like confluentinc/cp-kafka, automatically creating topics on startup can sometimes be tricky due to timing issues with ZooKeeper or Kafka itself. Here's how you can configure Kafka to automatically create topics:

Environment Variable for Auto-Creation: 
The environment variable you're looking for is KAFKA_AUTO_CREATE_TOPICS_ENABLE. However, be aware that with recent versions of Confluent Platform images, automatically creating topics might not be straightforward or even recommended for production due to potential race conditions or unintended topic creations.
Setting the Variable: If you want to enable topic auto-creation, you would set KAFKA_AUTO_CREATE_TOPICS_ENABLE to true. But keep in mind this might not solve your issue if it's timing or another configuration problem.
yaml
environment:
  KAFKA_AUTO_CREATE_TOPICS_ENABLE: "true"
This setting should theoretically allow Kafka to create topics if they don't exist when a producer tries to write to them or a consumer tries to read from them.
Using KAFKA_CREATE_TOPICS for Predefined Topics:
A more reliable method for ensuring topics exist before Kafka starts, especially in a Docker environment, is to use KAFKA_CREATE_TOPICS. This variable allows you to predefine topics with their configurations.
Example Configuration:
yaml
environment:
  KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092
  KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zookeeper:2181
  KAFKA_CREATE_TOPICS: "topic1:1:1,topic2:3:2"

Here, topic1 has 1 partition and 1 replica, and topic2 has 3 partitions with 2 replicas. This method ensures topics are created before Kafka starts, avoiding timing issues.
Troubleshooting Common Issues:
Race Conditions: Ensure ZooKeeper is fully operational before Kafka tries to create or use topics. You might need to add delays or retries in your startup script if using docker-compose up.
Correct ZooKeeper Connection: Verify that KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT is correctly pointing to your ZooKeeper service.
Check Logs: Always check the Kafka logs for detailed error messages around topic creation or general startup issues.
Alternative Approach with Scripts: If you're still encountering issues, consider creating topics via scripts post-startup or using Kafka's command-line tools after Kafka has initialized:
You can use docker exec to run kafka-topics.sh inside your Kafka container to create topics once it's up:
bash
docker exec -it kafka /etc/kafka/kafka_2.13-3.0.0/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic my_topic_name

Adjust the path and version as per your Kafka installation.
Ensure Docker Compose Order: In docker-compose.yml, ensure Kafka depends on ZooKeeper:
yaml
kafka:
  depends_on:
    - zookeeper

Even with depends_on, there's no guarantee on startup order or operational state, so sometimes adding a health check or wait script might be necessary.

Remember, while KAFKA_AUTO_CREATE_TOPICS_ENABLE can be useful in development or testing, for production environments, explicitly creating topics or using a tool like KAFKA_CREATE_TOPICS for pre-configuration is often preferred for better control and reliability.
Is there a way to automatically call kafka-topics.sh as part of kafka startup?
Answer
Automating the creation of Kafka topics as part of the Kafka service startup, especially in a Docker environment, can be achieved in a couple of ways. Here's how you might approach this:

Method 1: Using command in Docker Compose
You can modify your docker-compose.yml to execute kafka-topics.sh immediately after Kafka starts. However, this method has limitations regarding the timing of when Kafka is fully ready to accept commands.

yaml
version: '2'
services:
  kafka:
    image: confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.0.1
    depends_on:
      - zookeeper
    environment:
      KAFKA_BROKER_ID: 1
      KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zookeeper:2181
      KAFKA_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://0.0.0.0:9092
      KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://kafka:9092
    command: >
      bash -c "
      /etc/confluent/docker/run &
      sleep 10 &&
      /etc/kafka/kafka_2.13-3.0.0/bin/kafka-topics.sh 
      --create --topic my_topic --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1 --bootstrap-server kafka:9092
      "

Explanation: Here, we're overriding the default command to start Kafka in the background (&) and then wait for a few seconds (sleep 10) before creating the topic. Adjust the sleep time according to your setup's needs.

Method 2: Using a Health Check or Wait Script
Given that Kafka might not be immediately ready to accept commands after starting, a more robust solution involves using a health check or a wait script.

Health Check: Docker Compose doesn't support waiting for health checks, but you can simulate this with a script:

yaml
version: '2'
services:
  kafka:
    image: confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.0.1
    depends_on:
      - zookeeper
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "kafka-server-start.sh", "/dev/null"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
      start_period: 10s

Wait Script: This script waits for Kafka to be ready before executing kafka-topics.sh:

bash
#!/bin/bash

# Wait for Kafka to be up
until $(nc -z kafka 9092); do
  echo "Waiting for Kafka..."
  sleep 1
done

# Create topic once Kafka is ready
/etc/kafka/kafka_2.13-3.0.0/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic my_topic --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1 --bootstrap-server kafka:9092

You need to:
Save this script to a file, e.g., wait-for-kafka.sh.
Make it executable: chmod +x wait-for-kafka.sh.
Copy it to your Kafka container's startup scripts or run it from your host.

Method 3: Using Docker Entrypoint
You can modify the Kafka container's entrypoint to include the topic creation command. This involves creating a custom Dockerfile or modifying an existing one:

Dockerfile
FROM confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.0.1

COPY wait-for-kafka.sh /usr/local/bin/wait-for-kafka.sh
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/wait-for-kafka.sh

CMD ["bash", "-c", "/usr/local/bin/wait-for-kafka.sh"]

Build this image, use it in your docker-compose.yml, and ensure your wait-for-kafka.sh script accounts for startup timing issues.

Considerations:
Startup Order: Even with depends_on, services might not start in a guaranteed order. Hence, health checks or wait scripts are more reliable.
Environment Variables: Ensure all paths and environment settings in scripts match your Kafka and Docker setup.
Error Handling: Add error handling in scripts to retry or log failures, making your setup more robust.

These methods should help automate topic creation, but remember that in production environments, managing topics through scripts or automation might not cover all operational needs or might introduce timing issues if not carefully managed.
I prefer method #1 - as long as /etc/confluent/docker/run actually does start kafka from a bash shell inside the container.
Answer
Given your preference for Method #1, here's how you might structure your docker-compose.yml to start Kafka from a bash shell inside the container using the /etc/confluent/docker/run script, assuming it indeed starts Kafka:

yaml
version: '2'
services:
  kafka:
    image: confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.0.1
    hostname: kafka
    container_name: kafka
    depends_on:
      - zookeeper
    ports:
      - "9092:9092"
      - "29092:29092"
    environment:
      KAFKA_BROKER_ID: 1
      KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zookeeper:2181
      KAFKA_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP: PLAINTEXT:PLAINTEXT,PLAINTEXT_HOST:PLAINTEXT
      KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://kafka:9092,PLAINTEXT_HOST://localhost:29092
      KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR: 1

Replying to @Saboo_Shubham_
can  just launch this from a command line from the terminal with docker?
how can I determine the actual path to kafka-topics.sh ?
Answer
To determine the actual path to kafka-topics.sh inside the confluentinc/cp-kafka Docker image, you can use a few methods:

1. Interactive Shell into Container
If your Kafka container is already running:

Use docker exec to get into the container:
bash
docker exec -it <CONTAINER_ID_OR_NAME> /bin/bash
Once inside, you can look for the script:
bash
find / -name "kafka-topics.sh"

This will search the entire filesystem for kafka-topics.sh. Make sure to adjust your search depth if needed.

2. Run a Command Inside Container
If you haven't started the container yet or prefer not to hop into a shell:

Use docker exec to run find directly from your host:
bash
docker exec -it <CONTAINER_ID_OR_NAME> find / -name "kafka-topics.sh"

3. Check Image Filesystem
If you want to inspect the filesystem of the Docker image without running a container:

You can start a temporary container from the image and then immediately hop into it:
bash
docker run -it --entrypoint=sh confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.0.1
Then use find:
bash
find / -name "kafka-topics.sh"
Remember to adjust the tag (7.0.1 in this case) according to the version of the Confluent Kafka image you're using.

4. Using Docker History or Build Information
Look at the Docker image history for clues on where files might be installed:
bash
docker image history confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.0.1

This might not give you the exact path but can show layers where files were added.

Typical Path for Kafka Tools
From experience and checking the structure of Confluent Platform images, kafka-topics.sh is often found in paths similar to:

/etc/kafka/kafka_2.13-3.0.0/bin/kafka-topics.sh
/opt/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh (older versions might use this path)

Using This Information in Docker Compose
Once you've found the path, you can use it in your docker-compose.yml command:

yaml
command: >
  bash -c "
  /etc/confluent/docker/run &
  until /usr/bin/nc -z localhost 9092; do sleep 1; done &&
  /etc/kafka/kafka_2.13-3.0.0/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic my_topic --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1 --bootstrap-server kafka:9092
  "

Here, /etc/confluent/docker/run is assumed to start Kafka in the background (&), and we use nc (netcat) to wait for Kafka to be up before creating the topic.

Remember, Docker images might change their internal structure or file locations between versions, so always verify the path if you're using a different version or image than the examples provided.
I tried using find, but it said command not found
so I'll try ls -R / |  grep kafka-topics.sh
Answer
If you're encountering issues with find and are looking to locate kafka-topics.sh using ls -R / | grep kafka-topics.sh, understand that while this method can work, it's not the most efficient or recommended approach for several reasons:

Performance: ls -R / will recursively list every file in your system, which is extremely resource-intensive and slow, especially on systems with large file systems or many files.
Interactivity: If you're doing this interactively, it might hang or timeout, especially if your system limits on processes or output size are reached.
Security: Running ls -R / can potentially expose sensitive file paths if the output or its history isn't managed properly.

Given your situation, here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Check if Kafka Tools are in Your Shell's Path
First, try running kafka-topics.sh directly from your command line:

bash
kafka-topics.sh --version

If this works, you've found it, and you can skip to using it. If not, proceed to the next steps.

2. Locating with find (If Available)
If find is available but not found in your current PATH, you might need to use the full path to find. Typically, find is located in /usr/bin/, /bin/, or /usr/local/bin/. Try:

bash
/usr/bin/find / -name "kafka-topics.sh" 2>/dev/null

This command searches for kafka-topics.sh from the root directory (/), suppressing error messages with 2>/dev/null.

3. Using ls -R with grep
If find isn't an option, you could proceed with your initial thought, but with caution:

bash
ls -R / | grep kafka-topics.sh

Note: This will be slow and potentially overwhelming due to the output size.

4. Alternative Approach Using which or whereis
If the above methods are too cumbersome or fail, check if which or whereis commands are available:

bash
which kafka-topics.sh

or 

bash
whereis kafka-topics.sh

These commands are designed to find executables in your system's PATH.

5. Checking Documentation or Environment
If none of the above works, refer back to Kafka's or Confluent's documentation for your installed version. They might specify installation paths

kafka-topics.sh is at /usr/bin/kafka-topics
what is this preamble for ?  /etc/kafka/kafka_2.13-3.0.0
Answer
The path /etc/kafka/kafka_2.13-3.0.0 in the context of Kafka installations, especially within Docker images like confluentinc/cp-kafka, represents a directory structure where Kafka-related scripts, configuration files, and logs might be stored. Here's a breakdown:

/etc/kafka: This is often used as a base directory for Kafka configuration files and scripts. In many Linux distributions, /etc is used for system-wide configuration files.
kafka_2.13-3.0.0: This part of the path typically indicates:
2.13: This likely refers to the Scala version used to compile Kafka. Kafka's codebase is written in Scala, and each Kafka release is compiled against a specific Scala version. Scala 2.13 is one of the more recent versions used for Kafka.
3.0.0: This represents the Kafka version. Kafka uses semantic versioning, where 3.0.0 would indicate a major version update.

So, /etc/kafka/kafka_2.13-3.0.0 would be a directory where you might find Kafka binaries, scripts, and configuration files for Kafka version 3.0.0 compiled with Scala 2.13.

Purpose of This Directory Structure
Organization: This structure helps in organizing different versions of Kafka or differently compiled versions (by Scala version) in a way that they don't conflict with each other.
Configuration: /etc/kafka would typically contain default configuration files like server.properties, tools-log4j.properties, etc.
Binaries and Scripts: The subdirectories (like kafka_2.13-3.0.0) contain the actual Kafka binary files and scripts, including things like kafka-topics.sh, kafka-server-start.sh, etc.

Why kafka-topics.sh is at /usr/bin/
Global Access: Placing kafka-topics.sh in /usr/bin makes it globally accessible. This could mean:
It's been linked or symlinked from its original location for ease of use.
The Docker image or installation process might have moved or copied it there for system-wide availability.
Convenience: Having tools like kafka-topics.sh in /usr/bin means you can run them directly without specifying the full path, which simplifies command execution for users.

Using This Knowledge
Scripting and Automation: When scripting or automating tasks with Kafka, knowing where configuration files and scripts reside helps in correctly referencing them in your scripts or Docker commands.
Customization: If you need to modify configuration or scripts, you'd now know where to look or where to place custom configurations.
Troubleshooting: Understanding this structure can help in troubleshooting issues related to Kafka not finding its configuration files or scripts.

When you're setting up or configuring Kafka, especially in Docker environments, this knowledge helps in correctly referencing paths for scripts, configurations, and logs. If you're using docker-compose or directly managing containers, you might need to adjust paths or volumes according to where Kafka expects its configurations or where you want to persist data outside of the container.
what is /etc/confluent/docker/run ?
Answer
The /etc/confluent/docker/run script in the context of Docker images provided by Confluent, like confluentinc/cp-kafka or confluentinc/cp-zookeeper, is typically an entrypoint or startup script designed to initialize and start the respective service (Kafka, ZooKeeper, etc.) within a Docker container. Here's a breakdown of what this script typically does:

Purpose of /etc/confluent/docker/run
Service Initialization: This script is responsible for setting up the environment, initializing the service (Kafka, ZooKeeper, etc.), and starting it.
Environment Configuration: It might set or validate environment variables used by the service, which are often passed via Docker Compose or Docker run commands. These variables can include things like ZooKeeper connection details for Kafka, or Kafka settings for ZooKeeper.
Logging Setup: It might configure how logs are outputted, which is useful in a containerized environment where logs are often redirected or managed differently.
Service Start: The script likely calls the actual start command for the service, such as kafka-server-start.sh for Kafka or zookeeper-server-start.sh for ZooKeeper.

Usage in Docker
Default Entrypoint: When you run a container based on these images, /etc/confluent/docker/run might be set as the default entrypoint or command, which means the container launches this script to start the service.
Customization: If you need to customize how the service starts or add pre/post steps, you might override this command in your Docker run command or Docker Compose file. However, if you do override it, ensure you understand what this script does, as it might include necessary setup or checks.

Example of Overriding in Docker Compose
If you want to run a custom command after the service starts but before your application logic, you might do something like:

yaml
version: '2'
services:
  kafka:
    image: confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.0.1
    command: >
      bash -c "
      /etc/confluent/docker/run &
      # Your custom commands here
      sleep infinity  # Keep the container running
      "

Here, /etc/confluent/docker/run starts Kafka in the background (&), and you add your custom logic after ensuring Kafka is up.

Important Considerations
Compatibility: The script's content might vary slightly between different versions of the Confluent Platform Docker images. It's good practice to check the documentation or the script itself for any version-specific changes or behavior.
Custom Scripts: If you're developing your custom scripts or automation, you might find inspiration or elements from this script useful, especially for handling environment variables or setting up logging in containerized environments.
Security: Always ensure you're aware of what scripts like this are doing, especially if you're pulling in images from external sources or modifying them, to maintain the security and integrity of your services.
calling my own post script after starting kafka with & means that even if my custom post script fails, kafka itself will not be affected. Y/N?
Answer
Yes, that's correct. 

When you run /etc/confluent/docker/run & in a Docker container's command, you're starting Kafka in the background. This means:

Kafka Will Continue to Run: Even if your custom post script fails or exits with an error, Kafka, which is running in the background, won't be affected by this failure. It will continue to operate independently.
Independent Execution: The & symbol detaches the process from the main shell script, allowing it to run in the background. Consequently, any subsequent commands or script failures won't impact Kafka's operation.
Container Exit: However, if your custom post script completely exits (either successfully or with an error), and there are no other processes running in the foreground, the Docker container might exit as well, assuming there's nothing else keeping it alive. If you want the container to keep running regardless of your script's exit status, you might need an additional command to keep it running, like tail -f /dev/null or sleep infinity as sometimes done in Docker setup.

This approach is beneficial for scenarios where you need to perform some setup, configuration checks, or initialization tasks after Kafka starts, but you want to ensure Kafka's operation isn't tied to the success or failure of these tasks. However, remember to handle any failures gracefully in your custom script if there are dependencies between Kafka's state and what your script is doing, or if you're setting up additional services or configurations that Kafka might depend on.
please show me how I would use sleep infinity
Answer
Using sleep infinity in a Docker container's command or script is a common technique to keep the container running indefinitely, even if there are no foreground processes. Here's how you might incorporate it:

In Docker Compose
If you're using Docker Compose, you can include it in your command section:

yaml
version: '2'
services:
  kafka:
    image: confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.0.1
    command: >
      bash -c "
      # Start Kafka in the background
      /etc/confluent/docker/run &
      
      # Your custom script or commands here
      echo 'Running custom post-start script...'
      # Example command
      /usr/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic my_topic --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1 --bootstrap-server kafka:9092
      
      # Keep the container running indefinitely
      sleep infinity
      "

Directly in Docker Run Command
If you're running the container directly with docker run, you would structure it like this:

bash
docker run -d --name kafka \
  confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.0.1 \
  bash -c "/etc/confluent/docker/run & \
  /usr/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic my_topic --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1 --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 && \
  sleep infinity"

Explanation:
Starting Kafka: /etc/confluent/docker/run & starts Kafka in the background.
Custom Commands: After Kafka starts, you can run your custom commands or scripts. Here, I've used kafka-topics.sh as an example.
sleep infinity: This command ensures that the container doesn't exit immediately after running your custom commands. It effectively puts the main process into an infinite sleep, keeping the container alive indefinitely.

Important Notes:
Container State: While sleep infinity keeps the container running, it doesn't imply that Kafka or your custom commands are still executing. It just prevents the container from stopping due to no processes running.
Resource Usage: Note that sleep infinity consumes minimal resources but keeps the container running, which might be unnecessary if Kafka or other services are designed to run indefinitely on their own.
Signaling: Docker containers can be stopped or killed by Docker commands. sleep infinity won't prevent Docker from stopping the container, but it ensures the container doesn't exit on its own.
Alternative: If your custom script or commands are meant to run continuously (like a service), you might not need sleep infinity. However, if your commands are one-time operations and you want to keep the container running afterwards for monitoring or other reasons, this approach is useful.
Please review my local kafka startup bash script named start-kafka.sh

echo "Waiting for kafka to be ready... "
sleep 10

echo "Creating kafka topic... "

echo "kafka topic added"
Show more
Answer
Here's a review of your start-kafka.sh script:

Script Review:
bash
#!/bin/bash
#-set e  # This line has a typo; it should be '-e' or '--'
echo "Starting kafka... "
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up kafka 

echo "Waiting for kafka to be ready... "
sleep 10

echo "Creating kafka topic... "
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml exec kafka /usr/bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --create --topic user-login --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1

echo "kafka topic added"

Observations and Suggestions:
Shebang: 
Correct, it specifies bash as the interpreter.
Error Handling Line:
-set e should be corrected to -e or --. This enables immediate script exit if any command fails. It's a good practice for error handling, but ensure this is what you want for the entire script.
Starting Kafka:
Using docker compose (note the space) and specifying the docker-compose.yml file path is good for clarity. However, ensure docker and docker-compose are installed and accessible in your PATH.
Waiting for Kafka:
sleep 10: This is a simple way to wait, but it might not be sufficient in all scenarios since Kafka might not be ready immediately after starting. Consider implementing a more robust check, like trying to connect or checking Kafka's logs or health.
Creating Kafka Topic:
The command looks correct, assuming Kafka is accessible at localhost:9092 from inside the container. Note:
If Kafka is setup to only listen on internal network interfaces within Docker, you might need to use the container name or internal IP rather than localhost.
Ensure kafka is the correct service name as per your docker-compose.yml.
Error Handling and Script Robustness:
With -e or -- enabled, if any command fails (e.g., if Kafka isn't running or there's a connectivity issue), the script will halt. You might want to add error checking, like checking the return status of docker compose up or the topic creation command.
Logging and Output:
Your echo statements are good for tracking progress, but consider logging to a file or adding timestamps for better tracking, especially if used in a production or monitoring scenario.

Additional Recommendations:
Health Checks: Implement health checks for Kafka before creating topics. This could involve checking Kafka's logs or using a command like docker exec to check if Kafka is listening on its port.
Retry Logic: If topic creation might fail due to timing issues, consider adding a retry mechanism with a delay.
Logging: Log errors or success messages to a file for easier debugging or monitoring.
Script Exit Status: Explicitly set an exit status based on the success or failure of your operations if this script is part of a larger automation.
Env Variables: Consider using environment variables for Kafka host and port if there's a chance these might change or if you're dealing with multiple environments.

Here's a slightly modified version with some of these suggestions:

bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "Starting kafka..."
if ! docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d kafka; then
    echo "Failed to start kafka"
    exit 1
fi

echo "Waiting for kafka to be ready..."
sleep 1
please continue
Answer
Certainly, here's a continuation and enhancement of your script based on previous suggestions:

bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e  # Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status

# Function to check if Kafka is ready
check_kafka_ready() {
    local max_attempts=10
    local attempt=0
    local interval=5  # seconds

    while [ $attempt -lt $max_attempts ]; do
        if docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml exec kafka /bin/bash -c "nc -z localhost 9092"; then
            echo "kafka is ready"
            return 0
        else
            echo "kafka not ready yet. Attempt $((attempt+1)) of $max_attempts"
            sleep $interval
            ((attempt++))
        fi
    done
    echo "kafka failed to start or become available within timeout"
    exit 1
}

echo "Starting kafka..."
if ! docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d kafka; then
    echo "Failed to start kafka"
    exit 1
fi

echo "Waiting for kafka to be ready..."
check_kafka_ready

echo "Creating kafka topic..."
# Assuming kafka can reach localhost:9092, adjust if needed
if ! docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml exec kafka /usr/bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --create --topic user-login --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1; then
    echo "Failed to create topic"
    # Here you might want to decide whether to continue or exit
    exit 1
fi

echo "kafka topic 'user-login' added successfully"

Enhancements Explained:
Check Kafka Readiness: Added a function check_kafka_ready that attempts to connect to Kafka's port using netcat (nc). This method checks if Kafka's service is listening on localhost:9092 within the Kafka container.
Error Handling: 
The script now checks if each major step (starting Kafka, checking if Kafka is ready, creating a topic) was successful before proceeding. If a command fails, the script can choose to exit or log the failure and continue.
Retry Mechanism: 
For checking if Kafka is ready, there's a loop that retries connection attempts. This can be adjusted based on how long you're willing to wait for Kafka to start.
Script Structure: 
Each step is clearly separated with error checking, making it easier to debug or extend the script.

Considerations:
Kafka Bootstrap Server Address: Ensure that localhost:9092 is correct for connecting from inside the Kafka container to itself. If Kafka is configured to bind to specific network interfaces or if there's a network setup within Docker that changes this, adjust accordingly.
Logging: Added more detailed logging for better diagnostics.
Flexibility: If you need to handle cases where one step can fail but the script should continue, modify the exit 1 commands to log the error or perhaps notify using another mechanism.
Environment Specifics: This script assumes certain details about your Docker Compose setup and Kafka configuration. Ensure all paths, service names, and configurations match your actual environment.

Answer
Given your docker-compose.yml configuration, here's how you might adjust your start-kafka.sh script to better fit with your setup:

bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Function to check if Kafka is ready
check_kafka_ready() {
    local max_attempts=10
    local attempt=0
    local interval=5  # seconds

    while [ $attempt -lt $max_attempts ]; do
        if docker compose exec kafka /bin/bash -c "kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list"; then
            echo "kafka is ready"
            return 0
        else
            echo "kafka not ready yet. Attempt $((attempt+1)) of $max_attempts"
            sleep $interval
            ((attempt++))
        fi
    done
    echo "kafka failed to start or become available within timeout"
    exit 1
}

echo "Starting Kafka environment..."
docker compose up -d zookeeper kafka

echo "Waiting for Zookeeper to be healthy..."
docker compose wait zookeeper

echo "Waiting for kafka to be ready..."
check_kafka_ready

echo "Creating kafka topic..."
if ! docker compose exec kafka /usr/bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --create --topic user-login --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1; then
    echo "Failed to create topic 'user-login'"
    exit 1
fi

echo "kafka topic 'user-login' created successfully"

Key Adjustments and Considerations:
Starting Services: Your script now starts both ZooKeeper (zookeeper) and Kafka (kafka) together with docker compose up -d. This assumes both services should be up for Kafka to function properly.
Waiting for ZooKeeper: Added docker compose wait zookeeper which leverages the healthcheck you've set up in your docker-compose.yml for ZooKeeper.
Kafka Readiness Check: 
Used kafka-topics.sh --list within the check_kafka_ready function to check if Kafka is ready. This command should only succeed if Kafka can connect to ZooKeeper and is ready to serve requests.
Topic Creation:
The command to create the topic uses docker compose exec kafka which executes the command inside the kafka container, ensuring that localhost:9092 correctly points to Kafka within the Docker network.
Error Handling: 
The script will exit if topic creation fails. Adjust this behavior if you want to continue script execution despite failures.

Notes:
Health Checks: Your `docker-compose
please continue
Answer
Here's the continuation from where I left off:

Health Checks: Your docker-compose.yml already includes health checks for ZooKeeper (zookeeper) and Kafka (kafka). This is beneficial as it allows your script to wait for these services to be healthy before proceeding. 
Producer Service: You've defined a producer0 service which depends on kafka. Given this setup, if your script also needs to start or interact with the producer, you might want to add logic to start it after Kafka is ready or check if it's running.
Script Flexibility: If you're using this script in an environment where services might already be running or for debugging, consider adding checks or options to skip certain steps.

Here's how you could potentially extend your script to manage the producer service:

bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Function to check if Kafka is ready
check_kafka_ready() {
    # ... (previous function definition) ...
}

echo "Starting Kafka environment..."
docker compose up -d zookeeper kafka

echo "Waiting for Zookeeper to be healthy..."
docker compose wait zookeeper

echo "Waiting for kafka to be ready..."
check_kafka_ready

echo "Creating kafka topic..."
docker compose exec kafka /usr/bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --create --topic user-login --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Failed to create topic 'user-login'"
    exit 1
fi

echo "kafka topic 'user-login' created successfully"

echo "Checking if producer0 is running..."
if ! docker compose ps -q producer0 | grep -q .; then
    echo "Starting producer0..."
    docker compose up -d producer0
    echo "Waiting for producer0 to become healthy..."
    docker compose wait producer0
else
    echo "producer0 already running"
fi

echo "Kafka environment and producer0 are up and running"

Additional Considerations:
Service Checks: The script now includes a check to see if producer0 is running before attempting to start it. This can help avoid unnecessary container restarts if the service was already up.
Waiting for Producer: Using docker compose wait producer0 leverages the health check you've set up for producer0 in your docker-compose.yml.
Error Handling: Ensure that each critical step (like starting services, creating topics) checks for errors and handles them appropriately, either by logging, alerting, or exiting the script.
Script Maintenance: As your Docker Compose setup evolves, keep this script updated with new services or changed configurations.
Automation: If this script is part of a larger CI/CD pipeline or automation, consider how to handle cases where services might already be running or if you need to tear down and rebuild regularly.

This script now covers starting your Kafka ecosystem, ensuring services are healthy, and managing the producer service, making it a more comprehensive tool for managing your streaming setup. Adjust as needed based on your specific operational needs or any additional services you might introduce in your environment.

Answer
Your wait-for-service.sh script looks well-structured for waiting for a service to become available within a Docker container environment. Here's a brief analysis and potential enhancements:

Script Analysis:
Input Parameters: The script uses $1 and $2 to get service name and port from command-line arguments, which makes it versatile.
Netcat (nc): Using nc -z to attempt a connection without transferring data is an efficient way to check if a port is open.
Polling: The script polls every second (sleep 1), which balances between responsiveness and not overburdening the system with checks.
Error Handling: set -e ensures the script exits if any command fails, though for this particular use case, you might not need it since the loop will continue until the service is available
and here's my start-all.sh script:

#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "Starting zookeeper detached... "
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d zookeeper 

Wait for Zookeeper to be fully up and running
./scripts/utils/wait-for-service.sh zookeeper 2181

echo "Starting kafka detached... "
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d kafka 

Wait for Kafka to be fully up and running
./scripts/utils/wait-for-service.sh kafka 9092

Your start-all.sh script provides a sequential startup process for your services, which can be beneficial for ensuring each service is fully operational before starting the next. Here's a breakdown with some suggestions for enhancement:

Script Analysis:
Detached Start (-d): Services are started in detached mode, which means they run in the background, allowing the script to move on to the next step.
Custom Wait Script: You're using your wait-for-service.sh script to wait for each service before proceeding. This is good for ensuring service
continue
Answer
Here's a continuation of the analysis and some enhancements or considerations for your start-all.sh script:

Enhancements and Considerations:
Service Health Checks:
While waiting for a port to be open with nc is a good start, it doesn't necessarily mean the service is fully operational. For example, Kafka might have its port open but not be ready to accept all types of requests until it's fully initialized and connected to ZooKeeper. Consider using health checks specific to each service (like listing topics for Kafka or checking for a specific HTTP response for your producer).
Logging and Notifications:
You might want to log to a file for easier debugging or monitoring. Also, consider adding notifications (like email or Slack) for long-running scripts or if there's a failure.
Error Handling:
set -e is good for basic error handling, but you might want more granular control or logging for each step. For instance, what happens if one of the Docker commands fails? Do you want to retry, log, or exit?
Dynamic Environment Variables:
If you're using this script across different environments (development, staging, production), consider using environment variables for service names, ports, or Docker Compose file locations.
Additional Services:
If you add more services in the future, this script might need to scale. Consider a loop or function that can be called for each service.
Producer Health Check:
For the producer, you're checking if port 8080 is open, assuming it's running a web server. If it's just producing messages to Kafka, you might need a different health check mechanism.

Here's how you might refine your script with some of these considerations:

bash
#!/bin/bash

# Function to start and wait for a service
start_and_wait() {
    local service=$1
    local port=$2
    local wait_script=$3

    echo "Starting $service..."
    docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d $service

    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "Failed to start $service"
        exit 1
    fi

    echo "Waiting for $service to be ready..."
    $wait_script $service $port
}

# Log file
log_file="/tmp/start-all.log"
exec > >(tee -a "$log_file") 2>&1

# Start Services
start_and_wait zookeeper 2181 ./scripts/utils/wait-for-service.sh
start_and_wait kafka 9092 ./scripts/utils/wait-for-service.sh

for producer0 I am using image mprdaeep954/fetch-de-data-gen. It expects to find   envvars   BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS and  KAFKA_TOPIC, but I don't know how to determine if it has successfully started or if it has stopped. I suppose I could try to find the source code and documentation for it...
Answer
Given the scenario with your producer0 service using the Docker image mprdaeep954/fetch-de-data-gen, here's how you might approach verifying its health or functionality:

Checking Service Health Without Source Code:
Environment Variables: Ensure the environment variables BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS and KAFKA_TOPIC are correctly set in your Docker Compose file or environment. Incorrect settings here could prevent the producer from connecting to Kafka or producing to the wrong topic.
Docker Container Log: 
Use docker logs producer0 to check for startup logs or errors. If the container is running, this might give insights into whether it's successfully connecting to Kafka or if there are any immediate errors.
Kafka Logs: 
If you have access to Kafka logs, look for messages indicating a new producer has connected. Kafka logs might show connection attempts or successful producer connections.
Custom Health Check: 
If the image doesn't come with a built-in health check, you might need to create one. However, for producer services, traditional health checks might not suffice. You could define a health check in your Docker Compose:

yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "python", "/app/check_kafka_producer.py"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 10s

Here, check_kafka_producer.py would be a script that tries to send a test message to Kafka or checks if the producer can connect.
Checking Kafka for Produced Messages: 
You might not get direct feedback from the producer, but you can check if messages are being produced by:

bash
docker exec kafka kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic user-login --from-beginning

please suggest the code for     kafka-console-consumer.sh
Answer
Here's how you might structure a command to consume messages from a Kafka topic using kafka-console-consumer.sh within a Docker container:

Command Structure:
bash
docker exec -it kafka kafka-console-consumer.sh \
    --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
    --topic user-login \
    --from-beginning \
    --max-messages 10

Breakdown of the Command:
docker exec -it kafka: This runs a command inside the kafka container. The `-it
continue
Answer
Here's the continuation:

Breakdown of the Command:
docker exec -it kafka: This runs a command inside the kafka container. The -it flag allows for interactive mode, which might not be necessary if you're just running this command from a script without needing user interaction.
kafka-console-consumer.sh: This is the Kafka command-line tool to consume messages.
Flags:
--bootstrap-server localhost:9092: Specifies the Kafka broker to connect to. Note that within the container, localhost should point to the container's own loopback interface if Kafka is configured to only listen on localhost or 127.0.0.1. If it's configured to listen on a network accessible within the Docker network, use the service name (kafka) or its internal IP.
--topic user-login: Specifies the topic to consume from.
--from-beginning: Starts reading from the earliest message in the topic, rather than the latest.
--max-messages 10: Limits the consumer to read only 10 messages before exiting. Remove this flag or set it to a higher number if you want to continuously consume or for a longer period.

Usage in Your Script
If you want to check if producer0 is producing messages, you might add this command to your script with some additional logic:

bash
echo "Checking if producer0 is producing messages..."
# Consume 1 message to check if there's activity
if docker exec kafka kafka-console-consumer.sh \
    --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
    --topic user-login \
    --from-beginning \
    --max-messages 1 \
    > /dev/null 2>&1 && [ -s /dev/stdin ]; then
    echo "Producer0 is producing messages"
else
    echo "No messages from producer0 or Kafka issue"
fi

Explanation:
The command tries to consume one message and checks if any output was produced (with [ -s /dev/stdin ]). If messages are found, it implies that producer0 has successfully sent at least one message to Kafka's user-login topic.
> /dev/null 2>&1 redirects both standard output and error to /dev/null, so you're only checking if there was output without displaying it.
If you want to see the messages for debugging or verification, remove > /dev/null 2>&1 and adjust the script to handle or display this output.

This check assumes that producer0 produces messages at a rate where at least one message would have been sent by the time your script reaches this point. If the producer sends messages sporadically or not immediately, you might need to wait longer or run this check periodically until you're sure about the producer's status.
can kafka-console-consumer.sh peek at messages without consuming them?
Answer
Yes, kafka-console-consumer.sh can peek at messages without consuming them by using certain flags. Here's how you can do it:

Peeking at Messages:
You can use the --property option to configure the consumer's behavior. Specifically, setting isolation.level=read_committed can help in peeking at messages in a way that doesn't affect the offsets:

bash
docker exec kafka kafka-console-consumer.sh \
    --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
    --topic user-login \
    --from-beginning \
    --property isolation.level=read_committed \
    --max-messages 10

Key Points:
isolation.level=read_committed: This setting ensures that you only read messages that have been committed to the log, which means you won't see messages that are still in the process of being committed. This mode of operation does not change the consumer group offset.
Reading Without Consuming: 
This approach allows you to check for the presence of messages without advancing consumer group offsets. However, if you're running this in a consumer group, be aware that you might still see some form of consumption from Kafka's perspective if you're not careful with how you configure your consumer group or how you use this command.
Use Cases:
This is particularly useful for debugging, monitoring, or auditing purposes where you want to inspect what's in Kafka without impacting actual consumers' offset positions.

Considerations:
Consumer Group: If you're running this command in the context of a consumer group, even with isolation.level=read_committed, your command might still commit offsets if it's configured to do so. For true peeking without affecting offsets, ensure your command runs outside of any consumer group or explicitly disable auto-commit.
Offset Management: For complete non-intrusiveness, run this command outside of any consumer group context, or use the --group option with a unique group ID that doesn't interfere with your actual consumers.
Kafka Versions: This property might have different behaviors or additional options depending on the Kafka version you're using.

Example for Peeking:
If you want to truly peek without affecting offsets in a consumer group context:

bash
docker exec kafka kafka-console-consumer.sh \
    --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
    --topic user-login \
    --from-beginning \
    --property isolation.level=read_committed \
    --max-messages 10 \
    --group peek-group-123  # Use a unique group ID for peeking

Here, --group peek-group-123 assigns your peeking command to a unique consumer group that won't interfere with your actual consumer groups, assuming that group doesn't exist or isn't used by other consumers.

Remember, while this method allows you to peek at messages, it's still a form of consumption from Kafka's perspective, albeit one that's designed to minimize impact on your actual message processing.
please give me the contents of the kafka-console-consumer.sh script
Answer
The kafka-console-consumer.sh script isn't a script you would typically write or modify yourself; it's part of the Kafka distribution provided by Confluent or Apache Kafka. However, I can provide you with an overview of what such a script might look like or what it does, based on common functionalities of Kafka's console consumer tool.

Here's a conceptual overview or a template of what components you might find in such a script:

bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define usage message
usage() {
    echo "Usage: $0 [options]"
    echo "  --bootstrap-server <server:port>    REQUIRED: Kafka broker to connect to"
    echo "  --topic <topic>                     REQUIRED: Topic to consume from"
    echo "  --from-beginning                    Optional: Start reading from the beginning of the log"
    echo "  --max-messages <n>                  Optional: Maximum number of messages to consume"
    echo "  --property <key=value>              Optional: Additional properties for the consumer"
    echo "  --group <group-id>                  Optional: Consumer group to use"
    echo "  --timeout-ms <timeout>              Optional: Consumer timeout in ms"
    echo "  --help                              Display this help and exit"
    exit 1

Explanation:
Usage Message: Provides help on how to use the script.
Argument Parsing: Uses a case statement to parse command-line options and set variables.
Validation: Checks for required arguments.
Command Construction: Builds the Kafka consumer command based on the provided options.
Execution: Evaluates and runs the Kafka consumer command.

This script outlines a basic structure. Actual implementations might have more sophisticated argument parsing, error handling, or might directly call the Kafka client libraries rather than constructing and executing a command string. Also, real-world scripts might include more checks, logging, or options not shown here for brevity.

suppose I wanted to create a tranformer app which reads messages from the "user-login" topic 
processes it in some way
and sends a new transformed version of the user-login 
message to  another topic named "user-authenicated"

please give me the python code that 
is signaled/triggered when a user-login topic has a new message
consumes the message
processes the message
creates a the transformed message
publishes the tranformed message to user-authenticated topic.
Answer
Here's a Python script that creates a Kafka consumer for the "user-login" topic, processes the messages, and then produces them to the "user-authenticated" topic. This script assumes you're using the confluent-kafka library for interacting with Kafka:

python
from confluent_kafka import Consumer, Producer
import json
import time

def delivery_report(err, msg):
    """Called once for each message produced to indicate delivery result.
    Triggered by poll() or flush()."""
    if err is not None:
        print('Message delivery failed: {}'.format(err))
    else:
        print('Message delivered to {} [{}]'.format(msg.topic(), msg.partition()))

# Kafka consumer configuration
conf_consumer = {
    'bootstrap.servers': 'localhost:9092',
    'group.id': 'mygroup',
    'auto.offset.reset': 'earliest'
}

# Kafka producer configuration
conf_producer = {
    'bootstrap.servers': 'localhost:9092'
}

# Create Consumer instance
consumer = Consumer(conf_consumer)
# Subscribe to topics
consumer.subscribe(['user-login'])

# Create Producer instance
producer = Producer(conf_producer)

# Process messages
try:
    while True:
        msg = consumer.poll(timeout=1.0)
        if msg is None:
            # No message available within timeout.
            continue

        if msg.error():
            if msg.error().code() == KafkaError._PARTITION_EOF:
                # End of partition event
                print('%% %s [%d] reached end at offset %d\n' %
                      (msg.topic(), msg.partition(), msg.offset()))
            elif msg.error():
                raise KafkaException(msg.error())
        else:
            # Proper message
            message = json.loads(msg.value().decode('utf-8'))
            
            # Process the message (example transformation)
            transformed_message = process_message(message)
            
            # Produce the transformed message to user-authenticated topic
            producer.poll(0)  # Trigger delivery callbacks
            producer.produce('user-authenticated', 
                             key=msg.key(), 
                             value=json.dumps(transformed_message), 
                             callback=delivery_report)
            
            # Commit the offset if needed
            consumer.commit(asynchronous=False)

except KeyboardInterrupt:
    pass
finally:
    # Close down consumer to commit final offsets.
    consumer.close()

# Function to process the message
def process_message(message):
    # This is where you would perform your transformation logic
    # Here's a simple example that might authenticate a user based on some criteria
    if 'username' in message and 'password' in message:
        # Dummy authentication logic
        if message['username'] == 'user123' and message['password'] == 'pass123':
            message['status'] = 'authenticated'
        else:
            message['status'] = 'unauthenticated'
    else:
        message['status'] = 'incomplete'

    message['processed_at'] = time.time()
    return message

Key Points:
Configuration: Adjust bootstrap.servers to your Kafka broker address.
Message Processing: The process_message function is where you'd put your transformation logic. Here, it's a simple check for username and password, but you could implement any processing logic here.
Error Handling: Basic error handling is included, but you might want to expand this for production.
Commit Offsets: The consumer commits offsets after processing each message. If you want at-least-once semantics, you might commit before producing.
Producer: The producer sends messages to the user-authenticated topic with a callback for delivery reports.

Remember to install the confluent-kafka library
