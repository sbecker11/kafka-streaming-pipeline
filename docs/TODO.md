# Future Improvements

## Health Checks

### Python Producer Health Check Investigation
Need to investigate health check capabilities of mpradeep954/fetch-de-data-gen:
- Does it expose any health endpoints?
- What's the best way to verify it's functioning?
- Is port 9093 used for health status?
- Consider contacting the image maintainer for best practices

Current configuration:
```yaml
my-python-producer:
  image: mpradeep954/fetch-de-data-gen
  # No healthcheck currently configured
  # Other services (Kafka, Zookeeper) have healthchecks
```

### Potential Implementation Options
1. HTTP endpoint check if one exists
2. Process check
3. Connection to Kafka check
4. Custom health check script

### Questions to Answer
- What indicates a "healthy" producer?
- How to verify it's successfully connected to Kafka?
- What's the restart policy if health check fails?
