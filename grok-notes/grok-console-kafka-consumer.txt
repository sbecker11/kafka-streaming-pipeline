please suggest the code for     kafka-console-consumer.sh
Answer
Here's how you might structure a command to consume messages from a Kafka topic using kafka-console-consumer.sh within a Docker container:

Command Structure:
bash
docker exec -it kafka kafka-console-consumer.sh \
    --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
    --topic user-login \
    --from-beginning \
    --max-messages 10

Breakdown of the Command:
docker exec -it kafka: This runs a command inside the kafka container. The -it flag allows for interactive mode, which might not be necessary if you're just running this command from a script without needing user interaction.
kafka-console-consumer.sh: This is the Kafka command-line tool to consume messages.
Flags:
--bootstrap-server localhost:9092: Specifies the Kafka broker to connect to. Note that within the container, localhost should point to the container's own loopback interface if Kafka is configured to only listen on localhost or 127.0.0.1. If it's configured to listen on a network accessible within the Docker network, use the service name (kafka) or its internal IP.
--topic user-login: Specifies the topic to consume from.
--from-beginning: Starts reading from the earliest message in the topic, rather than the latest.
--max-messages 10: Limits the consumer to read only 10 messages before exiting. Remove this flag or set it to a higher number if you want to continuously consume or for a longer period.

Usage in Your Script
If you want to check if producer0 is producing messages, you might add this command to your script with some additional logic:

bash
echo "Checking if producer0 is producing messages..."
# Consume 1 message to check if there's activity
if docker exec kafka kafka-console-consumer.sh \
    --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
    --topic user-login \
    --from-beginning \
    --max-messages 1 \
    > /dev/null 2>&1 && [ -s /dev/stdin ]; then
    echo "Producer0 is producing messages"
else
    echo "No messages from producer0 or Kafka issue"
fi

Explanation:
The command tries to consume one message and checks if any output was produced (with [ -s /dev/stdin ]). If messages are found, it implies that producer0 has successfully sent at least one message to Kafka's user-login topic.
> /dev/null 2>&1 redirects both standard output and error to /dev/null, so you're only checking if there was output without displaying it.
If you want to see the messages for debugging or verification, remove > /dev/null 2>&1 and adjust the script to handle or display this output.

This check assumes that producer0 produces messages at a rate where at least one message would have been sent by the time your script reaches this point. If the producer sends messages sporadically or not immediately, you might need to wait longer or run this check periodically until you're sure about the producer's status.
can kafka-console-consumer.sh peek at messages without consuming them?
Answer
Yes, kafka-console-consumer.sh can peek at messages without consuming them by using certain flags. Here's how you can do it:

Peeking at Messages:
You can use the --property option to configure the consumer's behavior. Specifically, setting isolation.level=read_committed can help in peeking at messages in a way that doesn't affect the offsets:

bash
docker exec kafka kafka-console-consumer.sh \
    --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
    --topic user-login \
    --from-beginning \
    --property isolation.level=read_committed \
    --max-messages 10

Key Points:
isolation.level=read_committed: This setting ensures that you only read messages that have been committed to the log, which means you won't see messages that are still in the process of being committed. This mode of operation does not change the consumer group offset.
Reading Without Consuming: 
This approach allows you to check for the presence of messages without advancing consumer group offsets. However, if you're running this in a consumer group, be aware that you might still see some form of consumption from Kafka's perspective if you're not careful with how you configure your consumer group or how you use this command.
Use Cases:
This is particularly useful for debugging, monitoring, or auditing purposes where you want to inspect what's in Kafka without impacting actual consumers' offset positions.

Considerations:
Consumer Group: If you're running this command in the context of a consumer group, even with isolation.level=read_committed, your command might still commit offsets if it's configured to do so. For true peeking without affecting offsets, ensure your command runs outside of any consumer group or explicitly disable auto-commit.
Offset Management: For complete non-intrusiveness, run this command outside of any consumer group context, or use the --group option with a unique group ID that doesn't interfere with your actual consumers.
Kafka Versions: This property might have different behaviors or additional options depending on the Kafka version you're using.

Example for Peeking:
If you want to truly peek without affecting offsets in a consumer group context:

bash
docker exec kafka kafka-console-consumer.sh \
    --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
    --topic user-login \
    --from-beginning \
    --property isolation.level=read_committed \
    --max-messages 10 \
    --group peek-group-123  # Use a unique group ID for peeking

Here, --group peek-group-123 assigns your peeking command to a unique consumer group that won't interfere with your actual consumer groups, assuming that group doesn't exist or isn't used by other consumers.

Remember, while this method allows you to peek at messages, it's still a form of consumption from Kafka's perspective, albeit one that's designed to minimize impact on your actual message processing.
please give me the contents of the kafka-console-consumer.sh script
Answer
The kafka-console-consumer.sh script isn't a script you would typically write or modify yourself; it's part of the Kafka distribution provided by Confluent or Apache Kafka. However, I can provide you with an overview of what such a script might look like or what it does, based on common functionalities of Kafka's console consumer tool.

Here's a conceptual overview or a template of what components you might find in such a script:

bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define usage message
usage() {
    echo "Usage: $0 [options]"
    echo "  --bootstrap-server <server:port>    REQUIRED: Kafka broker to connect to"
    echo "  --topic <topic>                     REQUIRED: Topic to consume from"
    echo "  --from-beginning                    Optional: Start reading from the beginning of the log"
    echo "  --max-messages <n>                  Optional: Maximum number of messages to consume"
    echo "  --property <key=value>              Optional: Additional properties for the consumer"
    echo "  --group <group-id>                  Optional: Consumer group to use"
    echo "  --timeout-ms <timeout>              Optional: Consumer timeout in ms"
    echo "  --help                              Display this help and exit"
    exit 1
}

Explanation:
Usage Message: Provides help on how to use the script.
Argument Parsing: Uses a case statement to parse command-line options and set variables.
Validation: Checks for required arguments.
Command Construction: Builds the Kafka consumer command based on the provided options.
Execution: Evaluates and runs the Kafka consumer command.

This script outlines a basic structure. Actual implementations might have more sophisticated argument parsing, error handling, or might directly call the Kafka client libraries rather than constructing and executing a command string. Also, real-world scripts might include more checks, logging, or options not shown here for brevity.

Remember, kafka-console-consumer.sh is usually provided by Kafka distributions like Confluent or Apache Kafka, so you
suppose I wanted to create a tranformer app which reads messages from the "user-login" topic 
processes it in some way
and sends a new transformed version of the user-login 
message to  another topic named "user-authenicated"
