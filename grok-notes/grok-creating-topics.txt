I have found that when I attempt to have kafka automatically create a topic, it throws an error and exits. What is the correct environment variable name and value to create kafka topics?
Answer
When using Kafka with Docker environments, particularly with images like confluentinc/cp-kafka, automatically creating topics on startup can sometimes be tricky due to timing issues with ZooKeeper or Kafka itself. Here's how you can configure Kafka to automatically create topics:

Environment Variable for Auto-Creation: 
The environment variable you're looking for is KAFKA_AUTO_CREATE_TOPICS_ENABLE. However, be aware that with recent versions of Confluent Platform images, automatically creating topics might not be straightforward or even recommended for production due to potential race conditions or unintended topic creations.
Setting the Variable: If you want to enable topic auto-creation, you would set KAFKA_AUTO_CREATE_TOPICS_ENABLE to true. But keep in mind this might not solve your issue if it's timing or another configuration problem.
yaml
environment:
  KAFKA_AUTO_CREATE_TOPICS_ENABLE: "true"
This setting should theoretically allow Kafka to create topics if they don't exist when a producer tries to write to them or a consumer tries to read from them.
Using KAFKA_CREATE_TOPICS for Predefined Topics:
A more reliable method for ensuring topics exist before Kafka starts, especially in a Docker environment, is to use KAFKA_CREATE_TOPICS. This variable allows you to predefine topics with their configurations.
Example Configuration:
yaml
environment:
  KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092
  KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zookeeper:2181
  KAFKA_CREATE_TOPICS: "topic1:1:1,topic2:3:2"

Here, topic1 has 1 partition and 1 replica, and topic2 has 3 partitions with 2 replicas. This method ensures topics are created before Kafka starts, avoiding timing issues.
Troubleshooting Common Issues:
Race Conditions: Ensure ZooKeeper is fully operational before Kafka tries to create or use topics. You might need to add delays or retries in your startup script if using docker-compose up.
Correct ZooKeeper Connection: Verify that KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT is correctly pointing to your ZooKeeper service.
Check Logs: Always check the Kafka logs for detailed error messages around topic creation or general startup issues.
Alternative Approach with Scripts: If you're still encountering issues, consider creating topics via scripts post-startup or using Kafka's command-line tools after Kafka has initialized:
You can use docker exec to run kafka-topics.sh inside your Kafka container to create topics once it's up:
bash
docker exec -it kafka /etc/kafka/kafka_2.13-3.0.0/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic my_topic_name

Adjust the path and version as per your Kafka installation.
Ensure Docker Compose Order: In docker-compose.yml, ensure Kafka depends on ZooKeeper:
yaml
kafka:
  depends_on:
    - zookeeper

Even with depends_on, there's no guarantee on startup order or operational state, so sometimes adding a health check or wait script might be necessary.

Remember, while KAFKA_AUTO_CREATE_TOPICS_ENABLE can be useful in development or testing, for production environments, explicitly creating topics or using a tool like KAFKA_CREATE_TOPICS for pre-configuration is often preferred for better control and reliability.
Is there a way to automatically call kafka-topics.sh as part of kafka startup?
Answer
Automating the creation of Kafka topics as part of the Kafka service startup, especially in a Docker environment, can be achieved in a couple of ways. Here's how you might approach this:

Method 1: Using command in Docker Compose
You can modify your docker-compose.yml to execute kafka-topics.sh immediately after Kafka starts. However, this method has limitations regarding the timing of when Kafka is fully ready to accept commands.

yaml
version: '2'
services:
  kafka:
    image: confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.0.1
    depends_on:
      - zookeeper
    environment:
      KAFKA_BROKER_ID: 1
      KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zookeeper:2181
      KAFKA_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://0.0.0.0:9092
      KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://kafka:9092
    command: >
      bash -c "
      /etc/confluent/docker/run &
      sleep 10 &&
      /etc/kafka/kafka_2.13-3.0.0/bin/kafka-topics.sh 
      --create --topic my_topic --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1 --bootstrap-server kafka:9092
      "

Explanation: Here, we're overriding the default command to start Kafka in the background (&) and then wait for a few seconds (sleep 10) before creating the topic. Adjust the sleep time according to your setup's needs.

Method 2: Using a Health Check or Wait Script
Given that Kafka might not be immediately ready to accept commands after starting, a more robust solution involves using a health check or a wait script.

Health Check: Docker Compose doesn't support waiting for health checks, but you can simulate this with a script:

yaml
version: '2'
services:
  kafka:
    image: confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.0.1
    depends_on:
      - zookeeper
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "kafka-server-start.sh", "/dev/null"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
      start_period: 10s
