Answer
To change your iTerm2 profile dynamically based on the current working directory (cwd) or its children, you can use iTerm2's "Triggers" feature. Here's how you can set it up:

Steps to Configure iTerm2 Profile Switching:
Open iTerm2 Preferences:
Go to iTerm2 > Preferences or press Cmd + , to open the preferences window.
Select Profiles:
Navigate to the Profiles section.
Create or Select a Profile:
Ensure you have a profile set up for the directories you want to switch to. If not, create new profiles for different directories or environments.

Apologies for that. Here's how to continue setting up iTerm2 to change profiles based on the current working directory:

Steps to Configure iTerm2 Profile Switching:
Add Trigger to Change Profile:
In the profile you usually start with or the default profile, go to the Triggers tab.
Click the + button to add a new trigger.
Configure Trigger:
When: Choose Custom from the dropdown.
Action: Select Change Profile.
Profile: Choose the profile you want to switch to when in a specific directory.
Set Trigger Details:
Trigger: In the text field, you'll define when this profile change should occur. Here's an example trigger for changing when the cwd is /path/to/project or its children:
^zsh:([^:]*):0:.*$
Explanation: 
^zsh:: This matches the prompt of a zsh shell.
([^:]*): Captures everything up to the next colon, which in zsh is the current directory.
:$: Matches the end of the line.
Predicate: Choose pcre for Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions.
Condition for Profile Change:
In the Search field, type the path you're interested in, e.g., /path/to/project. 
Ensure the Regex option is selected so it matches not just the exact path but also any subdirectory.
Save and Test:
Click Add (or OK, depending on the version of iTerm2) to save this trigger.
Open a new terminal window or tab, navigate to /path/to/project or any subdirectory, and see if the profile changes automatically.

Important Notes:
Shell Compatibility: The trigger example given works for zsh. If you're using bash
