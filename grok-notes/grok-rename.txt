please give me a bash command that removes the .sh extension from all files in the current folder
Answer
To remove the .sh extension from all files in the current folder, you can use the rename command if it's available on your system. Here's how you can do it:

bash
rename 's/\.sh$//' *.sh

Explanation:
rename is the command for renaming files.
's/\.sh$//' is a Perl regex substitution:
\.sh$ matches the .sh extension at the end of the filename.
// means replace it with nothing, effectively removing the extension.
*.sh specifies to apply this substitution to all files with the .sh extension in the current directory.

Note:
If rename is not installed, you might need to install it. On Ubuntu or Debian-based systems, you can install it with:
bash
sudo apt-get install rename
On macOS, rename might already be available through macOS's Perl package or you might need to use perl -e or another method if rename isn't found:
bash
perl -e 'for (@ARGV) { $old = $_; $_ =~ s/\.sh$//; rename($old, $_) }' *.sh
Be cautious when using rename or any commands that modify files, especially without backups. Always ensure you're in the correct directory and have backups if needed.
If you're using a system where rename doesn't support Perl regex or you prefer a pure bash solution, you could use a loop:
bash
for file in *.sh; do
    mv -- "$file" "${file%.sh}"
done

This loop will rename each .sh file by stripping off the .sh extension using bash's parameter expansion (${file%.sh}).
I've always used mv to rename files. is rename a superiod approoach?
Answer
The rename command and the mv command in bash are both tools for renaming files, but they serve slightly different use cases, particularly when it comes to batch renaming:

mv Command:
Usage: Primarily used for moving files and directories, but it can also rename a single file or multiple files if used in a loop or with scripts.
Example for renaming:
bash
mv oldname newname
Or for batch renaming using a loop:
bash
for file in *.txt; do 
  mv "$file" "${file%.txt}.bak"
done
Pros:
Universal: Available on virtually all Unix-like systems.
Simple for single file renaming: It's straightforward when you know exactly what you want to rename a file to.
Cons:
Batch Renaming: Requires scripting or loops for bulk operations, which might be less intuitive for complex patterns.

rename Command:
Usage: Designed specifically for renaming files, especially useful for batch renaming based on patterns or regular expressions.
Example: 
bash
rename 's/\.txt$/.bak/' *.txt
This command would change all .txt files to .bak files.
Pros:
Pattern Based: Allows for more sophisticated renaming using regex. This makes it very powerful for batch operations where you want to apply a pattern or transformation to multiple file names.
Efficient: For complex renaming tasks, rename can be more concise and efficient than writing a loop with mv.
Cons:
Not Always Available: While common in many Linux distributions, it might not be installed by default on all systems. Users might need to install it (e.g., sudo apt-get install rename on Debian/Ubuntu).
Variations: Different versions of rename might exist (like the one from util-linux vs. the Perl version). This can lead to confusion if the command syntax varies unexpectedly.

Comparison:
Simplicity: For simple, one-off renames, mv is straightforward. However, for renaming files en masse with a common pattern, rename is usually more convenient.
Flexibility: rename offers regex capabilities which can be very useful for complex renaming tasks without writing scripts.
Efficiency: If you often need to perform batch renaming or complex renaming patterns, rename can save time and reduce error.
Learning Curve: If you're already comfortable with regex, rename might feel intuitive. For others, it might require learning regex, which could be seen as a slight barrier initially.

Conclusion:
For Simple Tasks: mv remains a robust, universally understood tool.
For Batch or Pattern-Based Renaming: rename can be superior due to its regex capabilities, making it more efficient and less error-prone for such tasks.

Both tools are valuable in their own right, and choosing between them often depends on the complexity of the task at hand and personal or team familiarity with regex and command-line utilities.
mac has no app named "rename"
Answer
The statement "mac has no app named 'rename'" is generally true in the context of pre-installed applications or default utilities directly named "rename." Here's a breakdown based on the information and common user experiences:

macOS Default Tools: macOS includes various tools for file renaming, but none are named simply "Rename" as a standalone application:
Finder's Bulk Rename: As highlighted by posts on X, macOS Finder has a built-in feature for bulk renaming which can replace text in filenames, add prefixes or suffixes, or apply numbering. This isn't an app per se, but a feature within Finder.
Terminal Commands: For command-line users, mv is used for moving or renaming files. However, rename command isn't a default macOS command but can be installed via Homebrew or other package managers. This command offers more advanced renaming capabilities similar to what one might expect from a dedicated rename app.
Third-Party Solutions: While macOS might not come

Did you know macOS Finder has a very cool file rename feature? It solves most common cases so there is no need in specialized apps. Here is an example where I add a normalized counter to a group of files:
I'm using "brew upgrade" then I'll use "brew install rename"
Answer
Given your approach, here's what you're about to do:

brew upgrade: This command will update Homebrew itself and any outdated packages or dependencies to their latest versions. It's a good practice to keep your packages up to date, ensuring you have the latest features, security patches, and improvements.
brew install rename: After updating, you're planning to install rename, a utility that's particularly useful for batch renaming files using Perl-compatible regular expressions.

Step-by-Step Execution:
Upgrade Homebrew and Packages:
bash
brew upgrade

This command might take some time if there are many updates or if you haven't upgraded in a while. It ensures that you're working with the most recent versions of software, which can be crucial for compatibility and security reasons.
Install rename:
bash
brew install rename

If rename isn't already installed, this command will fetch and install it. If it's already installed but not updated, brew upgrade might have already brought it up to date.

Why This Approach?

I just learned that you can run:

brew bundle dump

Which will dump a Brewfile with all of your installed programs and then you can move that to a new computer and run

brew bundle install

To reinstall them.

probably one of my most used aliases: an alternative to `git checkout` that uses fzf that gives you an interactive, searchable interface for checking out branches.

`brew install fzf` and then throw this in your .gitconfig https://gist.github.com/aweary/814cdbedf01a26290cf2852c6e9cdea7

Based on the brew info rename output you've shared, here's a breakdown of what it means:

Overview of rename on Homebrew:
Version: The stable version available is 1.601, and there's also an option to install the HEAD (latest development version).
Description: Described as a "Perl-powered file rename script with many helpful built-ins". This indicates it's a utility that uses Perl regex for batch renaming files, offering sophisticated renaming capabilities.
Status: "Not installed" means you haven't yet installed rename on your system using Homebrew.
Source: The formula for this software in Homebrew's repository is available at the provided GitHub link.
License: rename is released under the Artistic License 1.0 or GPL 1.0 or later, common for Perl software.

Dependencies:
Build Dependency: pod2man is listed, but with a cross ✘. This typically means it's required for building but isn't installed or wasn't found. However, pod2man is part of Perl, so it might be implied to be available if Perl is installed.

Options:
--HEAD: If you want
