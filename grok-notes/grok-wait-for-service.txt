Please review my local kafka startup bash script named start-kafka.sh

#!/bin/bash
-set e
echo "Starting kafka... "
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up kafka 

echo "Waiting for kafka to be ready... "
sleep 10

echo "Creating kafka topic... "
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml exec kafka /usr/bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --create --topic user-login --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1

echo "kafka topic added"

Here's a review of your start-kafka.sh script:

Script Review:
bash
#!/bin/bash
#-set e  # This line has a typo; it should be '-e' or '--'
echo "Starting kafka... "
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up kafka 

echo "Waiting for kafka to be ready... "
sleep 10

echo "Creating kafka topic... "
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml exec kafka /usr/bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --create --topic user-login --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1

echo "kafka topic added"

Observations and Suggestions:
Shebang: 
Correct, it specifies bash as the interpreter.
Error Handling Line:
-set e should be corrected to -e or --. This enables immediate script exit if any command fails. It's a good practice for error handling, but ensure this is what you want for the entire script.
Starting Kafka:
Using docker compose (note the space) and specifying the docker-compose.yml file path is good for clarity. However, ensure docker and docker-compose are installed and accessible in your PATH.
Waiting for Kafka:
sleep 10: This is a simple way to wait, but it might not be sufficient in all scenarios since Kafka might not be ready immediately after starting. Consider implementing a more robust check, like trying to connect or checking Kafka's logs or health.
Creating Kafka Topic:
The command looks correct, assuming Kafka is accessible at localhost:9092 from inside the container. Note:
If Kafka is setup to only listen on internal network interfaces within Docker, you might need to use the container name or internal IP rather than localhost.
Ensure kafka is the correct service name as per your docker-compose.yml.
Error Handling and Script Robustness:
With -e or -- enabled, if any command fails (e.g., if Kafka isn't running or there's a connectivity issue), the script will halt. You might want to add error checking, like checking the return status of docker compose up or the topic creation command.
Logging and Output:
Your echo statements are good for tracking progress, but consider logging to a file or adding timestamps for better tracking, especially if used in a production or monitoring scenario.

Additional Recommendations:
Health Checks: Implement health checks for Kafka before creating topics. This could involve checking Kafka's logs or using a command like docker exec to check if Kafka is listening on its port.
Retry Logic: If topic creation might fail due to timing issues, consider adding a retry mechanism with a delay.
Logging: Log errors or success messages to a file for easier debugging or monitoring.
Script Exit Status: Explicitly set an exit status based on the success or failure of your operations if this script is part of a larger automation.
Env Variables: Consider using environment variables for Kafka host and port if there's a chance these might change or if you're dealing with multiple environments.

Here's a slightly modified version with some of these suggestions:

bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "Starting kafka..."
if ! docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d kafka; then
    echo "Failed to start kafka"
    exit 1
fi

echo "Waiting for kafka to be ready..."
sleep 1
please continue
Answer
Certainly, here's a continuation and enhancement of your script based on previous suggestions:

bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e  # Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status

# Function to check if Kafka is ready
check_kafka_ready() {
    local max_attempts=10
    local attempt=0
    local interval=5  # seconds

    while [ $attempt -lt $max_attempts ]; do
        if docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml exec kafka /bin/bash -c "nc -z localhost 9092"; then
            echo "kafka is ready"
            return 0
        else
            echo "kafka not ready yet. Attempt $((attempt+1)) of $max_attempts"
            sleep $interval
            ((attempt++))
        fi
    done
    echo "kafka failed to start or become available within timeout"
    exit 1
}

echo "Starting kafka..."
if ! docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d kafka; then
    echo "Failed to start kafka"
    exit 1
fi

echo "Waiting for kafka to be ready..."
check_kafka_ready

echo "Creating kafka topic..."
# Assuming kafka can reach localhost:9092, adjust if needed
if ! docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml exec kafka /usr/bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --create --topic user-login --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1; then
    echo "Failed to create topic"
    # Here you might want to decide whether to continue or exit
    exit 1
fi

echo "kafka topic 'user-login' added successfully"

Enhancements Explained:
Check Kafka Readiness: Added a function check_kafka_ready that attempts to connect to Kafka's port using netcat (nc). This method checks if Kafka's service is listening on localhost:9092 within the Kafka container.
Error Handling: 
The script now checks if each major step (starting Kafka, checking if Kafka is ready, creating a topic) was successful before proceeding. If a command fails, the script can choose to exit or log the failure and continue.
Retry Mechanism: 
For checking if Kafka is ready, there's a loop that retries connection attempts. This can be adjusted based on how long you're willing to wait for Kafka to start.
Script Structure: 
Each step is clearly separated with error checking, making it easier to debug or extend the script.

Considerations:
Kafka Bootstrap Server Address: Ensure that localhost:9092 is correct for connecting from inside the Kafka container to itself. If Kafka is configured to bind to specific network interfaces or if there's a network setup within Docker that changes this, adjust accordingly.
Logging: Added more detailed logging for better diagnostics.
Flexibility: If you need to handle cases where one step can fail but the script should continue, modify the exit 1 commands to log the error or perhaps notify using another mechanism.
Environment Specifics: This script assumes certain details about your Docker Compose setup and Kafka configuration. Ensure all paths, service names, and configurations match your actual environment.
