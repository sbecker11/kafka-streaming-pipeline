DOCKER PS COMMANDS:
For a Quick Overview of Running Containers:
docker ps

To View All Containers (Running and Stopped):
docker ps -a

For Detailed Information Without Truncation:
docker ps --no-trunc

To Include Container Sizes:
docker ps --size

For a Quick List of Container IDs Only:
docker ps -q

To See Only the Latest Created Container:
docker ps -l

Though deprecated in favor of:
docker ps -n 1

If you want to combine filters or get very specific information, you might use:
docker ps --filter "status=running" --format "table {{.ID}}\t{{.Image}}\t{{.Status}}"
